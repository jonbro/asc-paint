 The file begins with the internal .xp format version number, You can ignore this value, as it is only used by REXPaint itself (in case future changes to the format are required). Note that because pre-R9 versions of REXPaint did not include an .xp version number, it's actually stored as a negative value to differentiate old image files (which begin with a positive layer count) in order to detect and automatically update them.
	The actual image data begins with A, the number of image layers (always a number from 1 to 9 in the current version), followed by a section B for each layer (the image width/height is stored for every layer due to the method of serialization used, but will always be the same values for every layer). Section C is then repeated for each cell in the image, storing the image's 2D matrix in 1D array format. I.e., the length of that matrix would equal width*height, and if you need them you can get the x-value with "index/height", and y-value with "index%height" (my own matrix class stores its data in a 1D array so I just read all the cells straight in). Note that this means the image data happens to be stored in column-major order!
	One thing to remember about directly reading .xp files is that undrawn (empty) cells on any layer (even the base layer) are considered transparent, which is identified by the background color 255,0,255. Thus to rebuild the image as seen in REXPaint, always first test a cell's background color and skip drawing those cells which are transparent, while converting any visible (i.e., non-covered) transparent cells on the lowest layer to black.
